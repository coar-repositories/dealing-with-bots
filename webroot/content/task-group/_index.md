The _Dealing With Bots COAR Task Group_ was formed, by invitation, in July 2025. Its remit is to investigate the phenomenon of sudden and dramatic increase in the deleterious impact on repository systems of the behaviour of unregulated "bad bots" (web-crawlers and other harvesting systems).

## Goals
The Task Group has set itself the following goals:
1. To understand and document the problem space sufficiently (and collect evidence where possible).
2. To understand and document the available mitigation strategies
3. To reiterate the importance of allowing legitimate machine-access to repositories
4. To make recommendations to repository managers about effective mitigation strategies which do not create problems for legitimate remote system access.
5. To make recommendations to COAR about what, if anything, can and should be done beyond this.
