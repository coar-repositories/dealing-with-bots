The Invenio documentation has specific pages on how to upgrade Invenio instances for each major version. The approach is to upgrade sequentially from one major version to the next. The three most recent upgrade guides are listed below:
- [Upgrading from v12 to v13.0](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/v13/upgrade-v13.0/)
- [Upgrading from v11 to v12.0](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/v12/upgrade-v12.0/)
- [Upgrading from v10 to v11](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/v11/upgrade-v11.0/)
