A Terms-of-service document is not likely to be machine-readable, and so not directly accessible to bots. However, clearly articulated terms of service are something that a repository should consider providing for both its human users, and for the people responsible for remote systems (bots) which might visit the repository.

Such terms of service should clearly articulate any licensing which is applied to the use of repository resources.

### Adding human-readable terms
It is also a good idea to add "human-readable" terms to the [robots.txt](/strategies/robots-txt/) file as "commented" text. Here are some examples:

- [https://www.nrc.nl/robots.txt](https://www.nrc.nl/robots.txt)
