The [Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR)](https://coar-repositories.org) conducted a survey in early 2025 to assess the extent to which repositories were being adversely affected by a sudden and large increase in activity by "bots" - automated Web clients such as crawling or harvesting systems.


The ensuing report - _[The impact of AI bots and crawlers on open repositories: Results of a COAR survey, April 2025](https://coar-repositories.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Report-of-the-COAR-Survey-on-AI-Bots-June-2025-1.pdf)_ - was published in June 2025. COAR then convened the  [Dealing With Bots Task Group](/about/) to develop advice and supporting information for repository managers to help them to deal with this phenomenon.

This website is the primary output of the Task Group. It provides a toolkit for repository managers who face the challenge of mitigating the effects, on their repositories, of badly-behaved bots.
