The [Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR)](https://coar-repositories.org) conducted a survey in early 2025 to assess the extent to which repositories were being adversely affected by a sudden and large increase in activity by "bots" - automated Web clients such as crawling or harvesting systems. The ensuing report - _[The impact of AI bots and crawlers on open repositories: Results of a COAR survey, April 2025](https://coar-repositories.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Report-of-the-COAR-Survey-on-AI-Bots-June-2025-1.pdf)_ - was published in June 2025. It makes clear that:

- the scale of traffic from badly-behaved bots presents a significant problem for open-access repositories
- the measures being taken by repositories vary in their effectiveness
- some of the measure being taken by repositories have unintended consequences of impeding access from legitimate users (both human and "machine")

In response to this, COAR convened the  [Dealing With Bots Task Group](/about/) to develop advice and supporting information for repository managers to help them to deal with this phenomenon. This website is the primary output of the Task Group.

One important conclusion from this work is that **there is no "silver bullet" solution** to this problem. It is clear that the nature of traffic on the Web has changed, and it seems certain that repositories will continue to deal with a range of bots, both welcome and unwelcome, and that the behaviour of such bots will in many cases be problematic. Repositories will need to walk a fine line between protecting their operations from being overwhelmed by traffic from unscrupulous actors, and maintaining their core mission of providing open access to legitimate users and machines.

The advice and information provided on this website is intended to help repository managers to make informed decisions about strategies they might use to achieve this balance in their own context. This is very much a **resource-in-development**. It has been sourced from the community, and we encourage repository managers to [share](/contributing/) their own experiences and insights so that we can continue to build a knowledge base that will help the community as a whole to deal with this challenge.
