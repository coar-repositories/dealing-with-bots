The primary way to contribute to this community resource is through commenting on GitHub issues.

Where possible, **please try to add comments to existing GitHub issues (see list to the right)** rather than creating new ones. This helps keep discussions organised and makes it easier for everyone to follow along. However, if there is no appropriate existing issue, feel free to [create](https://github.com/coar-repositories/dealing-with-bots/issues/new) a new one.

We are mainly interested in contributions towards improving the descriptions of the strategies documented here, and in suggestions for tools that can be used to implement these strategies. Endorsements for effective tools are especially welcome.

When commenting, please ensure your contributions are respectful and constructive. The goal is to foster a positive and collaborative environment for everyone involved.
