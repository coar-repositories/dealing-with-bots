<b>TL;DR</b>: If you are in a hurry, you can skip to a <a href="/quick-summary/"> quick summary </a> of some steps to take for dealing with bots.
</div>

This website provides a toolkit for repository managers who face the challenge of mitigating the effects, on their repositories, of badly behaved, automated Web clients such as crawling or harvesting systems.

It includes:
- Some context:
  - The wider [context](./context/) of an increase in "bot" traffic, and [COAR's vision](./context/#coars-vision-for-machine-accessible-repositories) for promoting well-behaved machine access to repository resources
  - A formal [problem-statement](./problem-statement/) about the effects of badly-behaved bots
- A [conceptual model](./model/) for characterising the nature and behaviour of "visitors" to repositories
- A logical [process](./process/) for determining how to deal with bots
- Some [tools and strategies](/strategies/) which can be used (in some cases with repository-specific advice)

While it is possible to jump straight to the process for dealing with bots, it is recommended to read the context, problem-statement and model sections first, in order to fully appreciate the thinking behind the process.

This toolkit is the primary output of COAR's [Dealing With Bots Task Group](/about/)
