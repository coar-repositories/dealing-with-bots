According to the Hyrax [README](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax):
Hyrax is a Ruby on Rails Engine built by the [Samvera community](https://samvera.org). As such, Hyrax is not a web application in itself, but is a major component which is mounted into a Rails application. The Samvera community calls an application that mounts Hyrax in this way a "Hyrax-based application".

Upgrading Hyrax therefore involves upgrading the version of the Hyrax gem that is included in your Hyrax-based application. Normally, this should be a relatively easy upgrade. However, Hyrax 5.0 introduced some significant changes to the architecture, so upgrading from versions before 5.0 may require more effort.
