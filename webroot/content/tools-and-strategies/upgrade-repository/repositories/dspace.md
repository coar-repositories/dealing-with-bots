According to the [DSpace documentation](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC9x/Upgrading+DSpace), DSpace offers two approaches to getting your installation up-to-date:
- [Upgrading to the latest release](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC9x/Upgrading+DSpace). This provides a walkthrough of how to install the latest version of the code over top of your existing DSpace installation, in order to upgrade to the latest version.
- [Migrating to the latest version](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC9x/Migrating+DSpace+to+a+new+server). This separate guide provides a walkthrough of installing a new copy of DSpace and migrating your existing production data into it.  This approach may be more useful if you wish to move your DSpace to a different server, or want to start "fresh" with the same data. The approach you choose is up to you.  Upgrading is often easiest for minor upgrades (e.g. 8.x → latest 8.x).  Migrating may be useful for major upgrades (e.g. 7.x → 8.x), or if you need to move your DSpace installation.
