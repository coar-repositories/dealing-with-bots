Sometimes it is more appropriate to limit the rate of access that one or more clients have to the repository. Preferred rates of access can be indicated in [robots.txt](/tools-and-strategies/robots-txt).

There are tools available which will enforce rate-limiting, either universally, or on a per-client basis. More sophisticated tools will impose rate limiting on clients which have crossed a configured threshhold of requests-per-second.
