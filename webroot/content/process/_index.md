This process has three phases: _Preparation_, _Protection_ and _Mitigation_. The process is inherently iterative, reflecting the need to adapt to continuously changing circumstances. For example, bots which are initially welcomed by the process may be subsequently identified as badly-behaved and declared unwelcome. It is important to note the repository (and its management) are almost certainly not the only actors involved in managing bots. The repository is deployed on a network - which probably has its own management, and it will almost always be situated in an organisation which may have its own policies and controls. Furthermore, there is an increasing trend to use network proxies - such as Content Delivery Networks - as a buffer between repositories and the wider internet.

For the purpose of this framework the term *repository* may sometimes imply the involvement of these other actors.
