"ai.robots.txt" provides a list containing AI-related crawlers of all types, regardless of purpose (some of which have been sourced from [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com)).

The list is provided in `robots.txt` format so that it can be used immediately _as-is_ or, more likely, incorporated into your existing `robots.txt` file.
