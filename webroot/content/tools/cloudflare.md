Cloudflare is a widely used content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a system of geographically distributed servers that deliver web content by making it available "closer" (in network terms) to users. Cloudflare has exploited this intermediary position to provide a variety of services beyond content delivery - notably [web application firewall (WAF)](/strategies/waf/) services and protection from DDoS attacks in general. More recently it has also begun offering more specialised protection, such as a [proof-of-work](/strategies/proof-of-work/) CAPTCHA mechanism, from badly-behaved bots.

While Cloudflare does offer some protection against a variety of online threats, it is a commercial service and users should be aware that using Cloudflare means routing all their web traffic through Cloudflare's servers. This has implications for privacy and data security, as well as potential vendor lock-in.
