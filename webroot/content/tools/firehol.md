This site analyses all available security IP Feeds, mainly related to on-line attacks, on-line service abuse, malwares, botnets, command and control servers and other cybercrime activities, and maintains a list.

This IP list is a composition of other IP lists.
The objective is to create a blacklist that can be safe enough to be used on all systems, with a firewall, to block access entirely, from and to its listed IPs.  The key prerequisite for this cause, is to have **no false positives**. All **IPs listed should be bad and should be blocked, without exceptions**.
